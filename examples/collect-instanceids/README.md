## Collect InstanceIDs

This example shows the random proxying behavior clearly by the different
InstanceIDs printed. It also makes it easy to observe how the Task Kite behaves
as tasks are added and removed.

To run this, simply run as many of the `serve-instanceid` tasks as you wish,
launch a `collect-instanceids` task, view the http server it provides, and
begin adding and removing further `serve-instanceid` tasks and observe the
behavior.
